# üíì Decoding Arrhythmias: Atrial Fibrillation Detection Using Hybrid Machine Learning Models

## üåü Overview
This repository explores the detection of **Atrial Fibrillation (AF)**, the most common cardiac arrhythmia, using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017 dataset, multiple models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), LightGBM, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and a Hybrid approach, were developed and evaluated to classify AF from ECG signals.

The **Hybrid Model**, combining SVM and LightGBM, emerged as the most effective, achieving superior performance in handling the complexities of AF detection.
